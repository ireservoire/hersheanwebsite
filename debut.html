<img alt="" height="400" src="HD%20_Taylor%20Swift_%20Debut%20Album%20Cover.jpg" style="float: right" width="400" /><span class="auto-style3">Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American 
singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released by Big Machine Records on October 24, 
2006, in the United States and Canada, and March 18, 2008, internationally. 
Swift had signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house in 2004, at age 14, to 
pursue a career as a country musician. Her contract with Big Machine Records in 
2005 enabled her to work on the album during her second high school year.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">Swift is credited as a writer on all 11 of the album's tracks, three of which 
solely; Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, Angelo Petraglia, and Liz Rose have 
co-writing credits. Drawing on her personal life, the songs reflect Swift's 
outlook on life as a teenager, dealing with romantic relationships, friendships, 
and insecurity. Produced by Orrall and Nathan Chapman, </span> 
<br class="auto-style3" /><span class="auto-style3">Taylor Swift is a country 
record with pop and pop rock elements, incorporating acoustic instruments such 
as guitars, banjos, and fiddles.</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">Five singles supported Taylor Swift, including the Hot Country Songs number-ones 
"Our Song" and "Should've Said No", and Swift's first top-15 entry on the 
Billboard Hot 100, "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift promoted the album through 
social network Myspace, which journalists found atypical for a country 
musician's marketing strategy. She embarked on a six-month radio tour in 2006 
and opened tours for other country artists throughout 2006 and 2007. Critics 
praised the album's mainstream sensibility and Swift's songwriting at a young 
age for earnestly depicting adolescent sentiments. Taylor Swift was nominated 
for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards.</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">The album spent 24 weeks at number one on Top Country Albums and peaked at 
number five on the Billboard 200, where it became the longest-charting album of 
the 2000s decade. Certified seven times Platinum by the Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA), it made Swift the first solo female country 
artist to write or co-write every song on a platinum debut album. Journalists 
attributed Taylor Swift's success to Swift's online marketing via Myspace, which 
ushered in a younger demographic in-country audiences who had mainly consisted 
of middle-aged listeners. The album's crossover appeal shaped the country pop 
style of Swift's next two albums, and its autobiographical narratives about love 
and heartbreak inspired the public and a subsequent generation of 
singer-songwriters.</span></p>
