(stylized in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by American 
singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album released on December 11, 
2020, via Republic Records, less than five months after Folklore, her eighth 
studio album. Evermore was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended 
collaboration with her Folklore collaborator Aaron Dessner, mainly recorded at 
his Long Pond Studio in the Hudson Valley.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the 
folklorian woods"—an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first ideated 
with Folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic; she regards them as sister albums. 
Evermore blends alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop styles, carried by 
fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion. 
Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia dominate its lyrical technique. The 
subject matter has been described as an anthology of tales about love, marriage, 
infidelity, and grief, exploring the complexities of human emotion. American 
bands Bon Iver, Haim, and the National appear as guest performers on the album.</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">Earning widespread acclaim from critics, Evermore was 
praised for its character studies, experimental production, and Swift's nuanced 
vocals. Reviews regarded the album a sequel or a counterpart to Folklore, and 
various publications listed it in their 2020 year-end rankings. Evermore was 
nominated for Album of the Year at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, a second 
consecutive nomination for Swift in the category after winning it with Folklore 
the previous year. Dessner and Long Pond have achieved mainstream notability 
since Evermore's release.</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">The album reached number one in Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States. Republic Records reported over a million copies of Evermore 
sold in its first week globally. It was Swift's eighth consecutive Billboard 200 
number-one debut, spending four weeks atop the chart, and achieved various chart 
feats in Australia, the UK and the US; in the latter, the tracks "Willow", "No 
Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" impacted pop, country, and alternative radio 
stations, respectively. "Willow" became Swift's seventh Billboard Hot 100 
number-one song and her second in 2020 after "Cardigan", making her the first 
ever act to simultaneously debut atop both Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts two 
times. Evermore was 2021's best-selling alternative music album and Americana 
album in the US and the UK, respectively.</span></p>
