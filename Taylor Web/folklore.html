(stylized in all lowercase) is the eighth studio album by American 
singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 
2020, via Republic Records. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
early 2020, Swift canceled the concert tour for her seventh studio album Lover 
(2019). She conceived Folklore during quarantine as "a collection of songs and 
stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness", working with producers 
Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; Dessner and Antonoff operated from 
recording studios in Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively, while Swift 
recorded her vocals in a home studio at her Los Angeles residence.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">Departing from the mainly upbeat pop production of its 
predecessors, Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by neo-classical 
instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electro-acoustic styles. 
Influenced by the isolation of quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism, 
empathy, nostalgia and romanticism in the album, using a set of characters, 
fictional narratives, and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone 
of her previous projects. The title was inspired by the lasting legacy of folk 
songs, whereas its visual aesthetic reflects cottagecore.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">Upon release, Folklore broke the record for the 
biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act.[note 1] Three of 
its tracks, "Cardigan", "The 1", and "Exile" featuring Bon Iver, reached the top 
10 on music charts in eight countries, with the former becoming Swift's sixth 
number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100. Folklore topped the charts in 
various countries and is certified platinum or higher in Australia, Denmark, New 
Zealand, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was 
Swift's seventh number-one album on the US Billboard 200, where it reigned atop 
for eight weeks and became the best-selling album of 2020.</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">Folklore received widespread critical acclaim, 
centering on its emotional weight, poetic lyricism, and relaxed pace. Critics 
found its introspective essence timely for the pandemic and regarded its sound a 
bold reinvention of Swift's artistry. The album was featured on numerous 2020 
year-end rankings. It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, 
making Swift the first woman in history to win the honor three times, following 
her wins for Fearless (2008) and 1989 (2014). She discussed Folklore and 
performed it live in the Disney+ concert documentary Folklore: The Long Pond 
Studio Sessions, premiering on November 25, 2020, and released Folklore's sequel 
record, Evermore (2020), two weeks later. Several artists cite Folklore as a 
source of inspiration.</span></p>
