(Taylor's Version) is the fourth re-recorded album by American singer-songwriter 
Taylor Swift. It is a re-recording of Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), 
and was released on October 27, 2023, via Republic Records. The album is part of

<span class="auto-style3">A 1980s-inspired synth-pop album, 1989 (Taylor's 
Version) is characterized by upbeat arrangements of synthesizers and percussion. 
It contains re-recorded versions of the 16 songs from 1989's deluxe edition and 
five previously unreleased "From the Vault" tracks.[a] Swift, Jack Antonoff, and 
Christopher Rowe produced the majority of the album; Ryan Tedder, Noel 
Zancanella, Shellback, and Imogen Heap reprised their production roles. Extended 
editions of the album additionally feature the re-recorded versions of the 
soundtrack song "Sweeter than Fiction" (2013) and the Kendrick Lamar remix of 
"Bad Blood" (2015).</span><br class="auto-style3" />
