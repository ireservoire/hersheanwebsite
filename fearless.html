Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the first re-recorded album by American 
singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 9, 2021, via Republic Records. 
It is the re-recording of Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), a 
counter-measure by Swift following the 2019 dispute over the ownership of her 
back catalog released by Big Machine Records. It includes six previously 
unreleased "From the Vault" tracks.[a] Of the re-recorded tracks, 13 are from 
the original Fearless release, six are from the 2009 Platinum Edition, and one 
was a soundtrack single ("Today Was a Fairytale") for the 2010 film Valentine's 
Day.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">Musically, Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country 
pop album composed of guitars, banjo, fiddle, and strings. The lyrics are about 
Swift's adolescent reflections and feelings on love and heartbreak. Swift and 
Christopher Rowe produced all but the unreleased tracks to replicate the 
original recordings: they feature identical arrangements but with instruments 
and vocals that are more defined and controlled. Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner 
worked with Swift to produce the vault tracks, which have an indie- 
and-electronic-oriented soundscape brought by synthesizers and drum programming. 
Two vault tracks feature guest vocals from Maren Morris and Keith Urban 
respectively.</span><br class="auto-style3" />

<span class="auto-style3">The album was preceded by "Love Story (Taylor's 
Version)", the re-recording of Fearless's lead single "Love Story", and two 
vault tracks, "You All Over Me" and "Mr. Perfectly Fine", all of which charted 
within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs. Fearless (Taylor's Version) topped the 
charts in English-speaking countries including the United States, where it 
became the first re-recorded album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 
chart. Critics praised the re-recorded album for what they deemed an enhanced 
production quality that brings a nostalgic feel, but some felt the vault tracks 
were insubstantial. Many attributed Swift's enduring popularity to the lyrical 
sentiments that appeal to a broad audience, and the media highlighted Fearless 
(Taylor's Version) as a significant event contributing to a wider industry 
discourse over artists' rights.</span></p>
